# TIPS n TRICK to master OS!
1. **DO THE TASK ASAP!!** don't procrastinate because if you do any task after the deadline, your score will be reduced :( 
2. **STUDY FOR YOUR QUIZZES PAL!** try out some of the questions from last year's exams
3. **DON'T SLEEP n ZOOM!**
4. **Set your alarm before quiz** so you won't miss the quiz :D
5. **Bismillah before everything!**
6. **DO THE TASK INDIVIDUALLY!** It is completely fine if you have some questions about the assignment and you need to ask your friends once in a while, but do not make it as a habbit! COBA CARI SENDIRI DULU BRAY!
